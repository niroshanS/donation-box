# Donation Box

This is a WIP project for a non-custodial donation pool powered by Compound. There are 0 tests and hardcoded values so if you do wanna clone this repo just know it won't work right out of the box :)

I'm also not a front-end dev so apologies for some of the hacky code, I promise to fix this up :see_no_evil:

## Goal
Donors can donate their Dai into the pool on behalf of a charity. The charities will be added by a trusted admin and they can redeem funds at any time. Charities are free to reedem up to a max of their percentage of the donation pool.

## How to run
TODO: Add instructions

## Demo
Here is a dmeo of what the project currently looks like
